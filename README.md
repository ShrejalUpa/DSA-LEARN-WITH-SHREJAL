DSA Preparation in Java

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) journey using Java. This repository contains the problems, solutions, and explanations for various DSA topics I'm learning.

üõ† Tech Stack:
- Language: Java
- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Topics Covered: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, and more.

üìÖ Progress Timeline:
- Started preparation for DSA in Java.
- Will be adding code implementations and solutions topic-wise.


üìñ Topics:
1. Arrays
   - Problem: Sum of Elements
   - Problem: Equal Partition
2. Linked Lists
   - Problem: Singly Linked List Implementation
3. Stacks
   - Problem: Implement Stack using Arrays
4. Queues
   - Problem: Implement Queue using Linked Lists

ü§ù Contributions:
Feel free to open issues or pull requests if you'd like to collaborate!

‚ö° Future Goals:
- Solve problems on LeetCode, Codeforces, and HackerRank.
- Implement advanced algorithms and understand time complexity.
  
Stay tuned for more updates!
